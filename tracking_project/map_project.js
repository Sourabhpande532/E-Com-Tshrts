!Ref: 🔗✈️https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function

-🎯ForgotPasswordToken It just Normal String Nothing more than that don't consider as a jsonwebtoken 
-🎯Need to Stored this String Into DATABASE itself & send to frontend somebuddy else 
-🎯use crypto package take Refference of 2nd last link 
-🎯we can perform simply No need to woryy on 'createHash,digest,update' & all stuff just go & simply stored like this.forgotPasswordExpiry = forgotToken it's OK !! No Problem 
-🎯But,OPTIONAlY Moving one step ahead BEFOUR one Read about last wikipedia Link 
-🎯About ref link 
   it Generate STRING which "fix in size" + find message only via "Bruit Force" which take long years & info not that much valuable + So in order to Resolve "Cryptographic_hash_function" Need of it; 
   

-@PROCESS 
 ^ Generate a long and random String 
   [nanoid,randomstring,uuid]
 ^ But😗, we'r using CRYPTO not any one of them it just for knowledge 
 ^ we'don't have to install it come with node itself;
 ^ take Refference of last two below link study perpose & with the help of that createHash update & digest

🔺-"/forgotPassword "- request an email How to reset Password + 
🔺-"/password/reset/:token" - The whole idea behind this Grabbed this UNIC string(via :token) just created at earlier Via CRYPTO 
& want to Grabbed this "URL" itself if "STRING" Matches with my DATABASE STRING So everything reset in backend itself; this is how it work;
Note: ALSO Allow PASSWORD Body itself 
🔺- Need All user info "/"
🔺- "/password/update" && "/user/update"
